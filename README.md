## 1) [Investigation into Fandango's Movie Rating Inflations](https://github.com/SphericalSilver/Probability-and-Statistical-Analyses-/blob/master/Fandango%2BInvestigation.ipynb)

It was discovered in 2015 that Fandango was inflating its moving ratings. Their officials said this was because of a bug that caused certain ratings to be rounded up.

Datasets from [before](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) and [after](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) the deployed fix were gathered and compared to see whether there was a significant difference in their movie ratings after the fix.
